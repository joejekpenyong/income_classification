    "In this income classification project, our objective is to identify the key characteristics associated with individuals who earn more or less than $50,000 per year. We will be working with a sample dataset from the US Census archive, which provides a comprehensive set of demographic, socioeconomic, and employment-related attributes for a diverse group of ~300,000 individuals. The dataset contains valuable information that can help us gain insights into the factors that contribute to income levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of our research question revolves around understanding the relationship between various features in the dataset and the target variable, which represents whether an individual earns more or less than $50,000 annually. By examining these characteristics, we aim to build a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals into their respective income categories based on their attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying the factors that contribute to higher or lower incomes is crucial for several reasons. It can provide valuable insights into income inequality, socioeconomic disparities, and the factors that influence financial success. Understanding these factors can help policymakers, organizations, and individuals make informed decisions and design targeted interventions to promote upward mobility and improve economic well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this project, we will leverage various machine learning techniques and statistical analysis methods to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, perform feature engineering, and train predictive models. Our goal is to uncover the most influential features and develop a robust classification model that can effectively distinguish between high and low-income individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "By successfully identifying the characteristics associated with different income levels, we can contribute to the understanding of socioeconomic dynamics and provide practical insights for decision-making in areas such as policy formulation, resource allocation, and economic planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive into the analysis and explore the census dataset to uncover the key factors that influence income classification.\n",

    "Dimensionality reduction is a valuable technique used in many data analysis and machine learning projects. For this project, we are applying dimensionality reduction to address the challenges posed by high-dimensional data. High-dimensional data refers to datasets with a large number of features or variables (typically more than 10). Although having abundant information can be beneficial, it can also lead to issues such as increased computational complexity, the curse of dimensionality, and overfitting. By reducing the dimensionality of the data, we aim to overcome these challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we drop some columns based on our domain expertise and considerations. The following columns are excluded from our analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `instance_weight`: We do not take into account the weight of each observation in the general population, as it is not relevant to our research question.\n",
    "- `industry_code` and `occupation_code`: The information contained in these columns is already captured in the major industry code and major occupation code variables, respectively, making them redundant.\n",
    "- `educ_last_wk`: This variable, which indicates an individual's education level from the previous week, is sparse as it does not apply to many respondents. Therefore, we exclude it from our analysis.\n",
    "- `region_prev_res` and `state_prev_res`: These variables, which provide information about an individual's previous residential state and region, respectively, are also sparse and do not apply to a significant number of respondents who are non-movers. Hence, we remove them from our dataset.\n",
    "- `household_details`: This column offers a more detailed version of the household_summary variable. To reduce dimensionality and avoid redundancy, we drop household_details.\n",
    "- `citizenship`: Since there is already another column (`sself_country`) that provides information about an individual's nationality, we exclude the `citizenship` column and rely on `self_country` instead.\n",
    "- `vet_quest`: This column is sparsely populated, and we can already determine if an individual is a veteran using the `vet_benefit` column. Hence, we remove `vet_quest` from our dataset.\n",
    "- `employer_size`: This variable exhibits high correlation with the number of weeks worked. Since the latter has higher variance, we decide to drop `employer_size` from our analysis.\n",

    "By dropping these columns, we aim to streamline our dataset and focus on the most relevant variables for our income classification task."
